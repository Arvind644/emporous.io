    UOR Typed Data.
---

UOR Typed Data follows similar rudimentary conventions to classical typed programming language concepts. Data types may be directly actionable objects, or may convey abstracts of other real objects or abstract concepts.

In this way UOR Typed Objects are a way to express any data, idea, or real world object and associate it with attributes and actions.

Objects may be of class 'object' or of class 'meta'. Object class objects are directly actionable by either read or execute actions. Meta class objects are objects that are not directly actionable, but are used to describe other objects.
